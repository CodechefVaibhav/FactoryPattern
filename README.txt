Any place where you need a run-time value to construct a particular dependency, Abstract Factory is the solution.

Having Initialize methods on the interfaces smells of a Leaky Abstraction.

Abstract Factory is combination of DI and Factory

Creational patterns abstract the object instantiation process.
They hide how objects are created and help make the overall
system independent of how its objects are created and composed.
a)  Class creational patterns focus on the use of inheritance to decide
the object to be instantiated
-> Factory Method
b) Object creational patterns focus on the delegation of the
instantiation to another object	
-> Abstract Factory

1) One more difference between Abstract Factory and Factory design pattern is that AbstractFactory pattern uses composition to delegate responsibility of creating object to another class while Factory design pattern uses inheritance and relies on derived class or sub class to create object.

Factory design pattern produces implementation of Products e.g. Garment Factory produce different kinds of clothes, On the other hand Abstract Factory design pattern adds another layer of abstraction over Factory Pattern and Abstract Factory implementation itself e.g. Abstract Factory will allow you to choose a particular Factory implementation based upon need which will then produce different kinds of products.

In short
1) Abstract Factory design pattern  creates Factory
2) Factory design pattern creates Products
